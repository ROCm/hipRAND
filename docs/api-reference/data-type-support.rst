hipRAND data type support
=========================

The data type support in hipRAND is similar to cuRAND. On AMD hardware, the backend is provided by rocRAND. To see the data type comparison between rocRAND and cuRAND, see :doc:`rocRAND's data type support <rocrand:api-reference/data-type-support>` page.

You can find the ROCm data type support summary at `Supported data types in ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/about/compatibility/precision-support.html#data-type-support-in-rocm-libraries>`_.

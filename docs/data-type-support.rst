====================
Data type support
====================

The data type support in hipRAND is similar to cuRAND. On AMD hardware, the backend is provided by rocRAND. To see the data type comparison between rocRAND and cuRAND, see `rocRAND's data type support page <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocRAND/en/develop/data-type-support.html>`_.

You can find the ROCm data type support summary at `Supported data types in ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/about/compatibility/precision-support.html#data-type-support-in-rocm-libraries>`_.

====================
Data type support
====================

The data type support in hipRAND is similar to cuRAND. On AMD hardware, the backend is provided by rocRAND. To see the data type comparison between rocRAND and cuRAND, see `rocRAND's data type support page <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocRAND/en/develop/data-type-support.html>`_.

You can find the ROCm data type support summary at :doc:`Supported data types in ROCm <rocm:about/compatibility/data-type-support>`.
